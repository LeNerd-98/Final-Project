        <h2>How to vote:</h2>
        <p>Users who are eligible to vote have to create an account to do so. Polls will be opened whenever there is enough money in the pool to create realistic goals for charities to achieve. The money in the pool will be split between the individual charities based on their ranking, so no charity ends up empty-handed.</p>

      <div class="col-5 ml-3 mb-3">
        <h2>How to donate:</h2>
        <p>Private individuals and businesses willing to donate large sums of money can apply to be sponsors using our sign up option and will be contractually bound to the money they’re willing to donate. Individual users can make accounts to donate smaller sums into the pool, and vote to rank the charities participating as voting options in the current poll.</p>
